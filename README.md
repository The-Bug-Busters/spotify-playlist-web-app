# üé∂ Spotify Song Search App to save them in playlists in local storage

[![Spotify Playlist CI/CD](https://github.com/The-Bug-Busters/spotify-playlist-web-app/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/The-Bug-Busters/spotify-playlist-web-app/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This project is the result of an exam assignment of the lecture "Web Services" 
at the DHBW in Friedrichshafen, Germany. 

The main part of the assignment was to deploy the application with Ansible and to demonstrate its capabilities.

**üëâ If online, you can see the application on [dhbw.yaman.pro](https://dhbw.yaman.pro/).**

## ‚≠ê Features

The web application only contains basic functionality to search a song and to add it to a 
playlist which will be saved in the local storage of the browser.
